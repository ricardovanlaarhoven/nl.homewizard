# Homey homewizard app (beta)
Adds support for some homewizard devices to the homey.
Inspired by the existing homewizard app for the homey I've decided to build a new one from scratch. Which supports the sdk 2.0 and soon the 3.0.

My goal is to atleast support the devices you can't connect directly to homey, the heatlink and the energylink. As far as I know all other devices like sensors and light bulbs can be connected directly to the homey.
