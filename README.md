# Homey homewizard app (beta)
Adds support for some homewizard devices to the homey.
Inspired by the existing homewizard app for the homey i've decided to build a new one from scratch.

My goal is to atleast support the devices you can't connect directly to homey, the heatlink and the energylink. As far as i know all other devices like sensors and lightbulbs can be connected directly to the homey.
